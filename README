This is just a simple Perl script I wrote, to convert a session agenda from a website into a helpful Excel file. This was written for droidcon 2011 originally.

The important part of the output, for me, is that multiple sessions starting at the same time are placed at the same column, easing the parsing needs on our brains. 

It expects input in a particular format: a text file for each day of the conference, and in each text file, lines starting with times as HH:MM and then containing the session details. 

If the session details ended with (Beginner) or (Intermediate) [as the droidcon agenda did], or contained any other parenthetical content at the end in fact, that would be brough to the beginning.

That's it, and I hope this script serves as a starting point to something useful.
